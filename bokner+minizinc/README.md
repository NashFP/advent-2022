# Advent of Code 2022 with MiniZinc

[Constraint programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming) could be an easy way to solve some puzzles.

The idea is to build the CP model from the constraints, and then let the CP solver to work out the answer.

I use [MiniZinc](https://www.minizinc.org), as it provides a good modeling language and a set of CP solvers out of the box.
And it's free!
